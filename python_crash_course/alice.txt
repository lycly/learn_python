    Good morning, dear professor. I'm very happy to be here for this interview.
    First, let me introduce myself. My name is Liu Yu, 25 years old. I come from Yixing city Jiangsu province. 
I graduated from Wuhan Textile University in June 2018. And my major is Electrical Engineering and Automation.
I want to pursue my master's degree in Software Engineering here.
    I am a hard-working person with great perseverance. I will try my best to finish a matter no matter how difficult it is.
In my spare time, I have broad interests such as reading books, running and listenning to music, and one of my favouriate one is 
reading books. I enjoy reading because whenever I have something that I can't deal with in my life and study, I can always find the 
answer from the book, which is definitely the most important meaning of reading books. In additon, reading books in a wide variety of
fileds dramatically and enriched my knowledge as well as broadened my horizon.
    When asked about why I want to be a postgraduate student, at least I have three answers. Frist, it wil broaden my horizon and deepen
my knowledge. Second, I firmly believe that being a postgraduate student enables me to better shape my personality. I wish I could be more
courageous and capable in dealing with troubles in life. Thirdly, I hope I can from systematic view of computer science and lay a solid foundation
in my future profession after three years of study here.
    I always believe that where there is a will, there is a way. If I am given a chance to study in Jilin University. I will make great efforts to master
my subjects.
    So that is all. Thank you for your attention.
